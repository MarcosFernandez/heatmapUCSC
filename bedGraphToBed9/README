General Description
___________________

This directory contains the source code for bedGraphToBed9

bedGraphToBed9 is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
bedGraphToBed9 is copyright by the Centro Nacional de Analisis Genomico.(CNAG).

bedGraphToBed9 transforms a bedgraph file (http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bedgraph.html) to
a bed file with 9 columns where the last column is and rgb color coordinate. The color is selected 
from a set of 10 rgb colors and acoording to its signal value and the range of signals.

Bedgraph:
chr	start	end	signal

Range = maximum signal value - minimum signal value

Number of color = ( signal / Range) * 10 

The final goal of this application is to create a bed file ready to be a track of a Heatmap to 
be viewed on a UCSC genome borwser instance.
